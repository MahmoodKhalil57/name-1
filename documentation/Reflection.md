7A asleep bec. KD is slow!

- problem faced by kd: doesn't know the most effecient way of adding css to quassar elements. 

progress: 

1- Got introduced to SASS(scss) & understood that this project uses it.

2- thought of using a css framework like tailwind, but realized that it would be better to discover quasar, and practice normall css along as scss for this project.

3- has syntax of sass and css, we use scss as it contains variables, nesting, mixins(@mixin-@include) with arguments, and functions.
