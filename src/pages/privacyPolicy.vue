      <span
        >While information is the cornerstone of our ability to provide superior
        service, our most important asset is our customers trust. Keeping
        customer information secure, and using it only as our customers would
        want us to, is a top priority for all of us at SooperMango. Here then,
        is our promise to our sooper customers:
        <ul>
          <li>
            We will safeguard, according to strict standards of security and
            confidentiality, any information our customers share with us.
          </li>
          <li>
            We will limit the collection and use of customer information to the
            minimum we require to deliver superior service to our customers,
            which includes advising our customers about our products, services
            and other opportunities, and to administer our business.
          </li>
          <li>
            We will permit only authorized employees, who are trained in the
            proper handling of customer information, to have access to that
            information. Employees who violate our Privacy Promise will be
            subject to our normal disciplinary process.
          </li>
          <li>
            We will not reveal customer information to any external organization
            unless we have previously informed the customer in disclosures or
            agreements, have been authorized by the customer, or are required by
            law.
          </li>
          <li>
            We will always maintain control over the confidentiality of our
            customer information.
          </li>
          <li>
            Whenever we hire other organizations to provide support services, we
            will require them to conform to our privacy standards and to allow
            us to audit them for compliance.
          </li>
          <li>
            We will attempt to keep customer files complete, up-to-date, and
            accurate. We will tell our customers how and where to conveniently
            access their information (except when we're prohibited by law) and
            how to notify us about errors which we will promptly correct.
